# BG3 Inspired HUD - D&D5e

A D&D 5e integration module for the BG3 Inspired HUD system. This module adapts the core HUD functionality for the D&D 5e system, providing token-specific HUD elements for abilities, spells, and effects with a design inspired by Baldur's Gate 3.

**This module requires the bg3-hud-core module to function.**

Coffee helps me stay up to 2am to write these modules. Thank you for the lack of sleep in advance!

I'm currently building my own TTRPG system, **Chantry**, which you can follow at [patreon.com/ChantryVTTRPG](https://www.patreon.com/ChantryVTTRPG). Don't worry, I'm not giving up on my other modules!
